I’m **Imani Marsden**, an IT support and operations professional based in Atlanta, GA, with hands-on experience solving complex user issues, managing remote workflows, and keeping systems running smoothly. I hold **CCNA** and **CompTIA Security+** certifications, and I’m deeply passionate about how technology can be both secure and human-centered.

I see technology as an art form: a medium for connection, intuition, and design. My goal is to build intelligent, emotionally aware tools that don’t just work — they resonate.
