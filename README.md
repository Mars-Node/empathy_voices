## 👤 About Me  

I’m **Imani Marsden**, an IT support and operations professional based in Atlanta, GA, with hands-on experience solving complex user issues, managing remote workflows, and keeping systems running smoothly. I hold **CCNA** and **CompTIA Security+** certifications, and I’m deeply passionate about how technology can be both secure and human-centered.  

After several years supporting and leading technical teams at **UnitedHealthcare**, **Wesper**, and **Alorica**, I began transitioning into **AI/ML engineering** — driven by a fascination with how creativity, empathy, and automation can merge to design systems that truly understand people.  

I see technology as an art form: a medium for connection, intuition, and design. My goal is to build intelligent, emotionally aware tools that don’t just work — they resonate.

## ✨ Future Plans
Empathy Voices is part of a larger journey toward Creative Systems Integration — blending AI, emotional design, and automation into experiences that feel as natural as conversation itself.
